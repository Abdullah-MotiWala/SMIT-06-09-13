    <q>Every action has an equal and opposite reaction ~Newton</q>

    <blockquote>
        It was the only way in which both the Muslims and the Hindus could prosper in accordance with their respective
        cultural values. In his speech, he emphasized that unlike Christianity, Islam came with "legal concepts" with
        "civic significance," with its "religious ideals" considered as inseparable from social order: "therefore, the
        construction of a policy on national lines, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity,
        is simply unthinkable to a Muslim."
